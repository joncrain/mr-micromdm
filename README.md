# MicroMDM module

This will be the middleware and webhook for a MicroMDM instance. Right now it functions by talking to some [custom middleware](https://joncrain.github.io/2018/11/08/micromdm_munki_partiii.html) for MicroMDM. 

Need to add in the ability to create and store DeviceLock/EraseDevice codes as well.
